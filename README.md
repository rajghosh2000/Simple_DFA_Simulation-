# Simple_DFA_Simulation-

Designing a DFA for a regular language L and writing a program to simulate the DFA. The program should be 
able to take any random string as input from the user and determine whether the string belongs to the
language L.

This program simulates and checks if string belongs to a given language or not i.e. 
if a string doesnot content two zeros at one go then the string belongs to the language.

CONDITIONS:

Language L = {w|w does not have the substring 00}
Set      Î£ = {0, 1}
